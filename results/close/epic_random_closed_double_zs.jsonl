This is the hardest part. You have to realize you\u2019re dreaming so to do that you need to find Dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc.  You can do this by keeping a dream journal.  Also practice all day awareness. Ask yourself randomly if you\u2019re dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. There are lots. The easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams.  2) Practice different techniques.  DILD-Dream induced. This one is the easiest but less reliable. By this point you should know some Dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights don\u2019t work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice you\u2019re dreaming.  WILD- Probably the most reliable, but many people report Sleep paralysis with it.  It\u2019s a wake induced LD. Essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during REM or closer to it.  There are others too FILD- Finger induced, DEILD- dream exit induced. There\u2019s tons but those are probably the most common.  3). You\u2019re lucid!  But you\u2019ll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). To do this you need to learn stabilization.  So calm down and slowly spin around. This stabilized the dream for most people. Another one is to rub your hands together slowly.  Think that\u2019s about the basics. Don\u2019t buy anything like masks.  They don\u2019t work. Supplements have different effects for everyone. Melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid.\nUser B:How do you feel when you are having a lucid dream?

Experts are saying just buy a little EXTRA each week, don\u2019t try to have your own Woollies at home and do all your shopping for a year. We don\u2019t want what\u2019s happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we\u2019re a remarkably self sufficient nation. Have a pantry and have enough; but let\u2019s not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours.  That being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing.  Remember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food.  Remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It\u2019s a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren\u2019t expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here\u2019s the thing, you probably don\u2019t.  What you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. If it runs out in stores because people are being Chicken Littles, vinegar kills 80% of germs. As someone else said, toilet paper is great and you\u2019ll miss it when you don\u2019t have it. Garbage bags too.  Prepare for possible power outages, the same way we did for the bushfires.

All camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. Any footage you see online is state sponsored.  The Air Force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 9/11 by Dick Cheney (The devil) himself  Proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased.  The third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives.

Nobody noticed any fallacies? And why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? The thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and I guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored?

At the beginning of the party i didn't know any of the other kids so we chatted for a while just playing some cart games and stuff and one of the 8 year olds doesn't feel well and wants to be brought home so his father brother and sister go to their house to put him to bed and not leaving him unattended while me the 15 year old girl and an 8 year old stay at the party for another hour so the boy can get some sleep. The father returned to the party btw. So after an hour the rest of us go to their home to just chill and have a good time i put the 8 year old to bed and as i turn around telling the kid goodnight i see behind me the 15 year old girl standing in the doorway now keep in mind that we didn't meet before the party and i only met her like 3 hours ago we did however kinda flirt throughout the night so we get out of the room and the sexual tension was immens we get it on and have sex in the parents bedroom while the 16 and 13 year old are downstairs and 2 8 year olds are two metres away i hear a door crack open to reveal one of the eight year olds asking what we are doing me being the super db smartass i am say that i dropped my phone and that we were searching it and that he should go to sleep but the stubburn little shitbag wants to help search we tell him to leave and we get clothed and in comes the 16 year old asking what we were doing.

It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak.

We are currently low risk.  We have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the Diamond Princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. While highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  Our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism. But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. If they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. Bhagat Singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter.\nUser B:As a Muslim this is exactly what they want us to do- react with violence on a large scale. All it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the RSS-BJP terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. The Sanghis basically use the Israel model of unity through hatred which works because most Indians(including Muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. The problem is not Hinduism or Islam. No religion encourages violence or hatred. The issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the Divider in Chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it.

Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.

I have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. Doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.   None of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. LP Pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.   Edit: Bonus image. Parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.   Edit 2, the sequel: It is not too. Currently lodging a formal complaint as my Employment Provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare.\nUser B:Excuse my French but that\u2019s fucked you went straight into the work for the dole phase.

Indian Muslims are Indians and will remain so.\nUser B:Pata nahi. Hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. Such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in India - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. Rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for Hindu appeasement.  So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win.  RSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000.  RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fj794yw", "scores": [0.6667333245277405, 0.3332667052745819], "gold": 0, "pred": 0, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:J Sea B\nUser B:nizlopsea\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fj79e8b", "scores": [0.3610626459121704, 0.6389373540878296], "gold": 1, "pred": 1, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:That's pretty boss.\nUser B:Alright Ali G calm down.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fj79hkz", "scores": [0.017219021916389465, 0.9827809929847717], "gold": 0, "pred": 1, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:Bit worried about it actually.

Being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. I agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. It\u2019s very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. Just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically. On the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, I\u2019ve gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once I find out he\u2019s straight. Yet there is a general sense of unease when I meet new straight guys, I think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they don\u2019t think I\u2019m in any way coming on to them at all, I would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. So baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because I\u2019m over-compensating for them knowing I\u2019m gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything I may do or say. Clearly I\u2019m reading a lot into it here, but I ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. The friends I have made as an adult have been through work and one guy I did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship.  Whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. Flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. I think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies. Instead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great Shia La Beouf; \u201cjust do it!\u201d\nUser B:Completely understand your sentiment. It's tough. You're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. Very frustrating.  Absolutely, I'm loyal to a fault and if I make plans with someone I will always stick to them unless I'm sick or something. Very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fj7d07f", "scores": [0.1795743852853775, 0.8204255700111389], "gold": 1, "pred": 1, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:I got a Christmas card from an Indian takeaway\nUser B:I think I\u2019m going to get shares in deliveroo\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fj7d5m1", "scores": [0.2582850754261017, 0.7417149543762207], "gold": 0, "pred": 1, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:Dont they print them in the local free rag anymore?\nUser B:Seeing your comment made me realise , I don't get a free local paper.

Photograph:  Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Paul Cullen Health Editor Updated: 2 minutes ago A Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus. The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital. Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease. The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening. The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it. Low risk It is understood the risk to other pupils in the Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms. Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms. hospital as officials trace contacts Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up. There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today. The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening: \u201cContact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case. The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days. All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of \u2018restricted movements\u2019. Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days. Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: \u201cContact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved. \u201cPatient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.\u201d The Department of Education said: \u201cThe Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.\u201d Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person\u2019s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on. The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health.\nUser B:What\u2019s with all the students traveling to Italy during February.

Coughing, sneezing and spreading germs everywhere and infecting their colleagues. Not to mention what this will do to the morale and panic levels now that we have Corona Virus to worry about.  It seems to have become the norm now that unless your leg is falling off, you need to show up. It's fucking stupid, usually people are incredibly unproductive when that sick and they end up making a rake of other employees sick which in turn has a much bigger impact on productivity and company profits than if they had stayed at home in bed and properly recovered.  We can't be calling in sick when we only have a dose of the sniffles or relatively minor ailments but some common sense from employees and bosses would go a long way to curbing the spread of this virus and the spread of seasonal flus in general.  You'd hope that most large companies are developing action plans and counter measures at the moment. Protocols on what to do if members of staff are ill, asking people to go or to remain at home, encouraging employees who don't need to be physically present to work from home where possible.  I'm mostly talking about standard, non customer facing office jobs here. I do understand for a lot of unfortunate people, this would be impractical due to a lack of sick pay allowance or the nature of their job means that it can't be done remotely. Then there's the huge percentage of people who simply can't afford to miss even one day without suffering financially.  We really need a plan for this in the event that it becomes as serious as Italy. We have nothing to lose by preparing and containing.\nUser B:I deal with customers at a front desk every day (not in healthcare btw).

I'm so happy.  \u2022 Landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms. \u2022 Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised. \u2022 Landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands. \u2022 Bond will now be capped at four weeks\u2019 rent. \u2022 Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. This covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. But they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person. \u2022 Landlords will now need an official order from the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet. \u2022 Tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. The landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time. \u2022 Victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they aren\u2019t held liable for the debts of their abusers. \u2022 Caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes. ** Fucking rental bidding. I've had to do it. Such a shit of an underhanded practise. Getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested...  Tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. Oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested... There are more coming into effect in July 2020: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/changes-to-renting-laws/all-changes-in-place-from-july-2020 Some highlights: Inappropriate rental application questions A rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application. Rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement Rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a \u2018no specified reason\u2019 notice to vacate. To end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property. Evidence for change of use notice to vacate Rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. The Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit. Bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements If a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the Act as though they were the rental provider. Expanded definition for urgent repairs Urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure. Long-term leases Renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. They must use the prescribed form to do so.\nUser B:>  Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised. Why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  In future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'?  >Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.

Just put out a video of global isolation and containment where he spoke about a paper in The Lancet. How to best control the outbreak by isolation of cases and isolation of the contacts of said cases. The R0 of Covid-19 is 2.6, meaning for every case, that person will infect 2.6 and so and so forth.  So basically the paper is saying the only way to contain this is to slow the process as much as possible and completely isolate cases and contacts. Imo we\u2019ve already fucked it with the way we\u2019ve handled our first case. In a small country like ours it should be easier to contain but if not acted upon properly it can spread faster. I think we are gonna be at Italy levels in the coming weeks. I\u2019m not trying to fear monger because the majority of us should be fine but it\u2019s so frustrating to see it not taken seriously by people.

We shouldn't be so naive as to think that the lower the better because war is bad. First of all, defence forces aren't just for fighting other militaries. They're responsible for a wide variety of tasks. They're the last line of defence in cases of armed violence. That has a few different meanings, but one of the main ones is terrorism. Obviously Islamic terrorism has never been a problem here, but Northern Ireland has had more terrorist attacks than any other region in Europe. The defence forces are the main reason why that violence didn't spill across the border. They were posted along the border in strength and had to repel multiple attempts by the IRA to set up on our side of the border. Also, in times of emergency, be it from extreme weather or pandemics, the defence forces can also be deployed to fulfil a broad range of roles. They also fill in for emergency services when people such as prison guards or paramedics go on strike. And lastly, they're generally regarded as among the best peacekeepers in the world. Ireland is a country that punches above our weight in terms of soft power and our commitment to peacekeeping is a huge part of that. The value of the soft power from peacekeeping vastly outweighs its costs. These are all essential services that we all take for granted. However, with expenditure at 0.3% of GDP, the defence forces are critically underfunded, which has left them in a crisis. Members are not getting fair pay and they're struggling to carry out their duties. With extreme weather and covid19 on our doorstep, we may find that the defence forces are not in the position to fulfil their emergency roles. We can still have among the lowest expenditure in the EU and increase funding to ease all of these problems.\nUser B:Nobody gives a fuck about Irish peacekeeping except for our local military fetishists. If your only argument for Ireland having an army is that they can back up front line civil services in an emergency then its already over. Just expand the civil defence and let the guards deal with the IRA as they have done fairly successfully since the beginning of the state. The only real reason to have an army is to wage war, and ireland would need at least 20 times the current army to survive a determined invasion by any realistic OPFOR for more than a few days, so why bother? A standing army in Ireland just makes it easier for the (non-existant) invasion force to kill our men.  &#x200B; Do an Iceland and get rid of it all I'd say, keep a few tanks and guns around for the children and the re-eanctors to ooh and ah over.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fj9hwgf", "scores": [0.8867623805999756, 0.1132376566529274], "gold": 0, "pred": 0, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:The ridiculous thing is if they are the flat tie on kind they don't protect the wearer so they are useless for people to steal.

Noting the explicit 3M trade mark  Cupped Particulate Respirator 8210, P2 > 8210 can also be used in certain applications against some bio-aerosols. such as, influenza virus Happy to have your expertise bear on any of that.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fj9hynz", "scores": [0.9626685380935669, 0.03733140975236893], "gold": 0, "pred": 0, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:Tinder - People are mostly looking for casual relationships and are very out there about wanting to hookup. Because of how famous it is, it attracts all sorts of crowd. Personally I thought it had a creepy vibe.... more scope of getting pervy messages. I would be a little careful here. Hinge - Hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. The platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. Though they are good I didn't find many guys who were looking for \"marriage\" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people. Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... Though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out. Have clear boundaries about how much you want to engage, and set the expectations from the get go. There are some good guys there, but you gotta keep looking!

He does not want to face questions. He lives in his echo chamber of his flatterers and occasionally caters to modia. I find Modi to be a very insecure person, scared, vengeful, delusional to an extent. He has another side though, which he presents to his audience,.. Brash, resolute, ambitious, flamboyant, dragon-slaying savior of people image. It is a projection. Such a projection would attract most people. He is a populist.

My dad was closest to the front of the store, runs out grabbing a durian and hurls it at the guy. So yeah, don't mess with Asian grocery stores if you don't want to get maimed!\nUser B:Durians kill people in Asia, never walk in a durian area at night as that\u2019s when they fall out of trees when ripe.

The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms.  The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about. In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised.  Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts. If theres any query regarding this please feel free to ask me any questions. I will answer what i know to my fullest.\nUser B:Thank you! Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.

Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.   Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.   I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.

And maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (I'm being conservative). Average of 9 trips a week then. Let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. That works out 1,216.8 a year. Current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.2=3,600. Let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. With this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability = 16,550 multiplied by 0.2=3,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. Savings of 290 euro. Also save on prsi but 18,000/52=346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on. Finally, USC, the 1,450 would not be subject to USC, so that's 2% of 1,450, = 29 euro. Total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131. That's a saving of 85.8 a year compared to the cost I calculated in my example. Then take into account nitelinks, which are included in the tax saver ticket. And the convenience of it. Even if only on the 2.15 bus fare it would still be worth it in my opinion.

Because our econmical outcome is looking worse and worse and the government isn't or can't do anything about it, the RBA has decided to lower the interest rate to 0.5%. This in turn is suppose to force your bank to lower your interest rate to 2.5% and you then use that extra 0.25% to go out and spend or invest it to try to stimulate the economy. >how this affects me?

From my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc.  The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems.

This is for everything they do, all conservatives do it constantly. Every problem caused by them is because of Labor, every bushfire is the Greens fault, every sports rort is a \"misunderstanding of the law and in no way corruption\", every coal-fired power plant an example of \"clean coal\", you halve a job and get two jobs for half the price, you get challenged by the media you don't like? They are lying we are telling the truth and their funding has been suspended. Every PM flung through a turntable? The Coalition is strong and some outdated anecdote about the Rudd vs Gilliard Years. We have a happy clapper running the country, a corrupt and abusive police officer with a major authoritarian chip on his shoulder in charge of our borders. A sycophantic banker in charge of the economy who couldn't give a toss about poor people, a ratty jobs minister who hid behind a whiteboard when asked the tough questions. Yet people still vote for them, people who never have benefited under a Liberal government. People who have been stuck on less and less wages, poorer welfare, limited access to childcare and healthcare and everything they value in their lives but who do they choose to direct their blame towards? The government that has ruined our country for close to a decade or Labor and the Greens? All these men and women do is get into positions of power and lie constantly, get cushy jobs, have expensive holidays and then they turn around to the struggling people below them and rip up all their support networks and benefits while buying up more and more and more and more and never stopping. Yet people still take them at their word because of the carrot dangling in front of them, vote for us less tax! Vote for us more money! Vote for us more energy! And then they achieve none of it and everyone just accepts they were lied to 4 years ago and everything is different at the next election because it's a different shitty face and name to check off.  He should just resign, in fact they all should, if any of them had decency they would have tendered their resignations years ago but they won't because they want money and power and to be the elite special class while costing Australians billions and holding the economy hostage. We have given them so much power and sway over us that it honestly doesn't seem to matter to a lot of people in this country that corruption has been accepted as normal and cool.

Even the pest ones are very skittish and good at hiding, so your building could easily be full of 'em without you noticing for a long time, and if you see one, he almost certainly has a few thousand close relatives nearby out of sight.  If you really want to see cockroaches for some strange reason, just head to the southeast US and you'll see some shit all right. I once spotted one in the kitchen in the house I grew up in down in Florida because I was in the sitting room watching TV and I heard it walking around. I dropped a cereal bowl on top of it and went to go grab something to capture it with, and when I got back the entire fucking bowl was trundling across the kitchen floor; that thing gave no fucks.  Oh, and did I mention some of the bigger ones (yes, there were bigger ones) fly? Back in Georgia I had a nest of 'em take up residence on my roof once, and every now and again one would get lost up there and fall down the chimney or the bathroom vent. Nothing like sitting on the toilet doing your business and hearing this *thud* *thud* *thud* *thud* *thud* sound descending the vent pipe, and then *schlorp*, out pops an enormous and mildly concussed cockroach which then proceeds to freak the fuck out and go whizzing around the room randomly bouncing off of everything, including your face.

And a number of these Shoppies are from places like South Australia, Northern Territory and my home state of Tasmania where the coal industry is either quite small or non-existent. >How very curious. Not from coal mining unions; not from coal mining states; but with the numbers in a pro-coal faction. - The Otis Group could easy be known as the New National Civic Council. What on earth are those Labor members who have found themselves in the Parliament because of their affiliation with a union that represents retail workers doing spruiking for coal? >https://youtu.be/vHIr1h_-qxc Now you might not care about internal labor politics but what it means is that the SDA gives sweetheart deals to companies as long as they help sign up new members for the SDA which gives them more clout inside the labor party. >A partnership was formalised with the SDA in 1971 when six major retailers, including Coles and Woolies, signed landmark \u201cclosed shop\u201d deals under which companies would sign up their staff as SDA members on the union\u2019s behalf.  >https://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2016/shopped-out/ But it generally means that they don't care about fighting for their members once they are signed up.

That deal now largely reflects the minimum rates of the award. >Nelio Da Silva, who has worked for more than five years at Coles, now gets paid an extra $140 a week under the new deal. >He recently joined the new union, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, whose secretary Josh Cullinan exposed the Coles deal in 2015. >\"'I was always after a union that represented me better,\u2019\u2019 Mr Da Silva said.

I go to explain I can't fold it and the driver just keeps telling me \"all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!\" I had no choice, I pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said \"it's not unoccupied now.\" If I could have held my screaming baba up to that man's ear like a seashell, I would have.

Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city.  If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.\nUser B:Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390.  I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one.  However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time.  I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fjcjunu", "scores": [0.6741187572479248, 0.3258812129497528], "gold": 0, "pred": 0, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:Depends on how the shipper sends it.

After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil)  Recipe for coconut milk gravy:  In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee. Add in chopped tomatoes and mix add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.) mix spices and wait for oil to be released. add 1 can of coconut milk and mix. bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.  Plating:  Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer place fried fish use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat) garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.  Peanut Chutney: Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:  Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown peel off any remaining skin pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts. You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture. \nUser B:That just looks scrumptious.

You have to exchange bodily fluid to infect, so the idea is probably (hazarding a guess) that they aren't exchanging saliva etc. Will be interesting to see when an adult is diagnosed if they quarantine their partner.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fjdqfeb", "scores": [0.42914503812789917, 0.5708550214767456], "gold": 0, "pred": 1, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:Tough enough.

Ever since then the world has gone fucking mental.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fjejv9t", "scores": [0.7177879810333252, 0.2822120487689972], "gold": 0, "pred": 0, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:Good that we are detecting them at least. That's better than not detecting them. This   \"east of ireland\" thing is bullshit though. Now I have to go off to   twitter to find out where this is. It would be much better to just issue   a postcode or general area. I don't even need to know more than that   right now, but \"east of ireland\" is bullshit. And Holohan has the  arrogance to say hse.ie  is a \"one stop shop\" and \"Social media is NOT a place to go for  information to go to figure out how to deal with this virus\"? The idiot  is forcing me to go to social media because he won't tell us the general  area this person has been living and working in the last few days. https://twitter.com/newschambers/status/1234947168877891584 Edit:  I see  Dr Tony Holohan said we have tested 397 people so far.  That's a  pretty good increase since 2 days ago when I think it was 90.  To me  that's helps raise my confidence in the hse a bit. https://twitter.com/newschambers/status/1234944054493880321 Edit  2: Then Holohan goes and says \" he does NOT believe it likely that  there are more cases than the two currently known in the Republic of  Ireland\". That takes away from my confidence in the HSE. Why is he  allowing himself to make guesses? He should stick to providing hard  accurate information. Let the politicians handle the positivity. https://twitter.com/newschambers/status/1234948261921906688 Edit 3: look at the level of detail they have about the outbreak in Singapore. This comes from their health authority giving accurate, precise information to their people. https://twitter.com/RyutaroUchiyama/status/1234616723615166465\nUser B:Where is it?\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fjejvbm", "scores": [0.14870323240756989, 0.8512967824935913], "gold": 1, "pred": 1, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:Winning Streak never moved on from the 80s.\nUser B:RTE never moved on from the 80's.\n\nIs B's answer to A ironic?Answer by yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is"}], "seed_phs": {"labels": 0, "system": 0, "user": 0, "assistant": 0, "intro": 0, "input": 0, "question": 0, "format": 0}, "subs": ["system", "user", "intro", "question", "format", "input", "labels", "parent_text", "text", "assistant"]}, {"id_original": "fjenbqj", "scores": [0.719501256942749, 0.280498743057251], "gold": 1, "pred": 0, "turns": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below is a dialogue between user A and user B.\n\nUser A:We need to build a wall around Leinster.
